      <h2>Timing as a system parameter</h2>
      <p>
        Time is often treated as background infrastructure — assumed to be “good enough” once clocks are distributed.
        In large distributed systems this assumption breaks down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Timing quality directly affects correlation, stability, reproducibility, and the physical meaning of measured events.
        Phase errors, asymmetries, and non-deterministic delays accumulate into system-level behavior that cannot be fixed locally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Murosync treats time and phase as <strong>first-class system parameters</strong>, subject to measurement, control,
        and architectural trade-offs.
      </p>

      <h2>Emergent synchronization</h2>
      <p>
        The conceptual inspiration behind Murosync comes from emergent synchronization phenomena:
        global coherence arising from local interactions rather than centralized control.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>distributed nodes with local timing awareness</li>
        <li>measurement-driven alignment loops</li>
        <li>system-level validation rather than isolated optimization</li>
      </ul>

        Murosync is research-first: it documents experiments and the constraints discovered along the way.
