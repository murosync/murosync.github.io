      <h2>1. Context</h2>
      <p>
        This note investigates the effect of asymmetric delay on phase alignment accuracy in distributed FPGA-based timing systems.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Experimental setup</h2>
      <p>
        Point-to-point optical link with configurable asymmetry (or controlled path differences),
        measured at the system level.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Method / measurement</h2>
      <p>
        Phase is measured using a DDMTD-based approach as a baseline reference.
        Logging focuses on repeatability, drift, and residual phase error under varying asymmetry.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Results</h2>
      <p>
        Observed phase error increases with uncompensated asymmetry beyond a practical threshold.
        (Quantitative results to be added once the measurement sweep is finalized.)
      </p>

      <h2>5. Observations / interpretation</h2>
      <p>
        Asymmetry introduces a system-level bias that cannot be corrected by phase alignment alone.
        This motivates explicit asymmetry measurement and compensation, or a model that accounts for it.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Next questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Can asymmetry be detected without explicit round-trip measurement?</li>
        <li>How does this scale in cascaded or meshed topologies?</li>
        <li>What is the stability limit over time and temperature?</li>
      </ul>
